        <p>Research the position and organization (e.g., mission, goals, etc.) prior to the interview. Re-familiarize yourself with the job announcement details including the duties, requirements, and evaluation methods of the position. Do not assume you know everything about the organization even if you have experience with the organization. Always do your research.
Review your application (e.g., resume and assessment questionnaire responses) to assist preparing real examples of past accomplishments that directly supports what is required of the position and what you submitted with your application package. Be sure that highlight any paid and non-paid experiences. Non-paid experiences may include "lived experience" which is defined as direct, first-hand involvement in activities or events in a person's life that enable a deep understanding or knowledge of issues and their application in the work environment. Do not assume the interviewer knows everything about you.
Practice interviewing. Take the time to research and review typical interview questions to help give you a framework for your responses. Be sure to review the competencies outlined in the announcement as that may be a guide in determining what type of interview questions may be asked of you.
Be flexible with scheduling and allow sufficient time for the interview. Be sure to ask for specifics about the time, location, point of contact (POC) as well as any other logistical details.
Ask whether there will be one or multiple interviewers.
If you need accommodations for the interview makes sure to ask for them as early as possible.
Make sure you have a business professional outfit for the interview that fits well.
Print a few physical copies of your resume, if possible. Prepare a clean, neutral-colored folder that includes copies of your resume, a pen and notepad, and a printout of your interview logistics.</p>

Send a thank you email to your contact or those you interview. Use this to highlight your strengths or areas from the interview you wish to provide more context.
Be patient. Remember the hiring process takes time. You can follow up with your POC if you have not been contacted within the established timeframe.
Notify your HR Specialist and POC if you choose to withdraw your application. This may occur as a result of you accepting another job in the time you are waiting for a response or change your mind about being open for consideration.
The hiring official is looking for the right person with the right skills to fill the vacant position. It is up to you to show that you are that person during the interview. If you have questions about these tips, please contact your servicing Component HR representative.</p>

  <h2>RESUME BUILDING GUIDE</h2>
  <p>Your resume is often your first and best chance to show employers why you’re the right fit for the job. A strong resume doesn’t just list your experience—it tells your story, highlights your accomplishments, and sets you apart from other candidates. This guide will walk you through the key steps to create a professional, polished resume that effectively showcases your skills and achievements. Whether you’re starting from scratch or updating an existing resume, you’ll find tips and strategies to make your resume clear, compelling, and tailored to your goals. Let’s get started.</p>

  <h3>Choose the right resume format</h3>
  <div class="resume-image">
    <img src="../image/guideresume.png" alt="Resume Format Overview" />
  </div>

  <strong>There are three major options to consider.</strong>

  <p><strong>Chronological Format (Reverse Chronological Resume)</strong> - Most Popular: This is the most common format, in which your work experience and qualifications are listed chronologically, beginning with the most recent. It is generally recommended for most job applications.</p>

  <p><strong>Functional Format (Skills-Based Resume):</strong> This format focuses on your abilities and skills rather than your work experience. It's ideal for those with limited experience or looking to change careers.</p>

  <p><strong>Combination Format (Hybrid Resume):</strong> This format combines elements of both chronological and functional resumes, emphasizing your skills and work experience. Choosing the format that best suits your background will make your resume stand out.</p>
